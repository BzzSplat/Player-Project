(wait till I even Make the relays) relay checkDistance function, causes a chain reaction down a line of relays to check if they are all within reach of eachother and break off relays and machines that are not

game manager constants
array of all material images, when somethign needs a list of materials, it uses the array's length and the elements for the images
make large numbers in the silo turn into scientific notation above 999,999 (format for first number would be 1.00x10^6)

Fix movement with moving planets
player velocity = normal velocity + movement vector3 (acceleration problem)
player velocity = normal velocity - oldMovement then + new movement ("rubberband" problem)

Store Vector3"VelocityNoMove" before applying move or subtract the move from it after 
velocity has been updated(latter prob better because no override of external force.
Then before movement is applied set velocity to "VelocityNoMove" then reapply force.

toolbox item, press T to open radial menu to select different tools like welder (later have different tiers of tools, better welded allows for larger durability numbers)
inventory system (???)

BUILDING:
~ materials (energy, metals, gasses, liquids, ect)
~ machines that do stuff with items (craft items, refine/smelt ores)

SHIP BUILDING:
premade ship peices with snap points
machines such as grav generators, thrusters, chairs, ship weapons, FTL drive, ect
FTL in three types, multiplicitive (multiplies current speed), boost (speed boost in pointing direction), and teleport (set distance or coords and warp)
no grid based building (bulding stuff like in gmod, maybe alignment tool)
thruster paths ideas:
-Fulksor Engine: a very efficient but weaker thruster (name comes from fusion because it is efficent, or at least I think so)
-Krater Engine: a stronger thruster but very not efficient (name from Kratos, a god of strength and power and it's ability to leave craters after liftoff)
-Jackson Engine: a middle point between the two other thrusters (name from jack of all trades)
