toolbox radial
better linking (simply override the inport variable, and in the linker do (if var secondLink.type == firstLink.inport.type))
refinery and tier 2 metal

Fix movement with moving planets
player velocity = normal velocity + movement vector3 (acceleration problem)
player velocity = normal velocity - oldMovement then + new movement ("rubberband" problem)

Store Vector3"VelocityNoMove" before applying move or subtract the move from it after 
velocity has been updated(latter prob better because no override of external force.
Then before movement is applied set velocity to "VelocityNoMove" then reapply force.

toolbox item, press T to open radial menu to select different tools like welder (later have different tiers of tools, better welded allows for larger durability numbers)
inventory system (???)

BUILDING:
~ materials (energy, metals, gasses, liquids, ect)
~ machines that do stuff with items (craft items, refine/smelt ores)

SHIP BUILDING:
machines such as grav generators, thrusters, chairs, ship weapons, FTL drive, ect
FTL in three types, multiplicitive (multiplies current speed), boost (speed boost in pointing direction), and teleport (set distance and warp)
no grid based building (bulding stuff like in gmod, maybe alignment tool)
