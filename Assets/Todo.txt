finish producer popup thingy (spawn it in, don't worry about reuseable stuff right now, just get one working)
health and more weapons (the raycasts)
fix miner spam (if you spam the miner it will quickly produce metal)

Fix movement with moving planets
player velocity = normal velocity + movement vector3 (acceleration problem)
player velocity = normal velocity - oldMovement then + new movement ("rubberband" problem)

Store Vector3"VelocityNoMove" before applying move or subtract the move from it after 
velocity has been updated(latter prob better because no override of external force.
Then before movement is applied set velocity to "VelocityNoMove" then reapply force.

toolbox item, press T to open radial menu to select different tools like welder (later have different tiers of tools, better welded allows for larger durability numbers)
inventory system (???)

BUILDING:
~ placment of machines on planet ground
pipes to connect machines (rope tool from gmod)
~ materials (energy, metals, gasses, liquids, ect)
machines that do stuff with items (craft items, refine/smelt ores)

SHIP BUILDING:
machines such as grav generators, thrusters, chairs, ship weapons, FTL drive, ect
FTL in three types, multiplicitive (multiplies current speed), boost (speed boost in pointing direction), and teleport (set distance and warp)
no grid based building (bulding stuff like in gmod, maybe alignment tool)
