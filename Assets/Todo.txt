spawn machines from spawn menu

Fix movement with moving planets
player velocity = normal velocity + movement vector3

Store Vector3"VelocityNoMove" before applying move or subtract the move from it after 
velocity has been updated(latter prob better because no override of external force.
Then before movement is applied set velocity to "VelocityNoMove" then reapply force.
